                <p>After completing my training as an industrial clerk, I supported the management of Omega Technology
                    in controlling with
                    the development of various Qlik BI applications.
                    It always appeals to me to implement sophisticated and intelligent solutions for the analysis of
                    business processes and data in a team.

                    In my Software Engineering studies at the Fontys University of Applied Sciences Venlo in the
                    Netherlands, the focus is on practice-oriented development. In the course of this study I have
                    further deepened my already previously developed fascination with data:

                    Porsche AG internship - Here I developed a process mining app for the inbound logistics material flow
                    with the Celonis EMS software including Action Flows, Views, Pycelonis API and SQL programming.
                    PricewaterhouseCoopers internship - In this five months internship, I implemented a 3-tier ETL architecture including BI
                    dashboards according to Kimball for an international chemical company. To this date, this project is
                    being expanded and used as a blueprint for other departments.
                    German crime statistics 2019 - In the third semester, we restructured the published police report
                    using R: With the help of linear regression, we were able to prove a significant relationship
                    between the number of suspects and the identification of the perpetrator.
                    Currently, we are going one step further: together with the Dutch police, we are developing an
                    data-driven system: the goal here is to simplify and speed up documentation by identifying the
                    correct crime category. This makes the work of officers on the street more intuitive and easier.
                </p>
                <p>Im always excited to learn new stuff. Currently im broadening my skills in machine learning using
                    Python: Tensorflow, SKlearn and the pandas library</p>
